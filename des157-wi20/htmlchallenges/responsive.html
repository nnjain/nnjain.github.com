                <h2>About Media Queries</h2>
                <p> Media query uses the media rule to include a block of CSS styling rules to only if a certain condition is true. It is important for responsive design which means creating web pages that dynamically change in response to different screen sizes. The min-width and the max-width are just as they sound. When we define min-width it means that the designing rules will be applied when the screen size is equal to or more than the width defined. For max-width, on screens that are the defined width or less, apply the certain rules. We should design mobile first because due to the less screen space, we will focus on the vital aspects of the website. This will then impact our design for tablets and desktops. The order goes smaller-then-larger.</p>

                <h2>Relative Units</h2>
                <p>A relative unit in CSS means a specific elememt gets sizing in relation to some other element. In font relative length, units can be defined as em, ex, ch and rem. There is also a % value, which is always relative to another value. Using relative values means that things can scale up and down according to some other value.</p>

                <h2>Meta Viewport Tag</h2>
                <p>A browserâ€™s viewport is the area of web page which is visible to the user. The viewport varies with the variation in screen size of the devices on which the website is visible. The meta viewport tag allows the browser to render the width of the webpage at the width of its own screen. This means that when we are using smaller screens, the webpage doesn't looked zoomed out to a bigger width. When I view my webpages without using the meta viewport tag, I have to scroll the content of the entire webpage since it is not the same size as the smaller screen.</p>
