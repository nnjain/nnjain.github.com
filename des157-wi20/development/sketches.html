        <p>During this process, I was able to understand the importance in hierarchy. It was important to understand the placement and structure that the website would be using especially since it is a way to gather feedback. While sketching out the development visually, I realised that it could be a challenge to make it look interesting and visually appealing for the user since they would have to answer a couple of questions. This could be boring which is why I sketched out an interesting interface which allows the user to explore more and understand the important of the subject. I focused on the narrative behind the interactive space which would make the user aware of the problem.</p>
