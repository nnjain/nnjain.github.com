        <p>The brainstorming definitely helped me get a better sense of my ideas. During this process, I didn't want to limit myself to one category so I let my ideas flow through the use of word association. This allowed me to look at things with a different perspective and embrace the unknown. Due to the mind map, I could list out certain problems that would need to be acknowledged and if possible, solved. However, given that it is such a broad topic, I have still not limited a specific project or idea that I would want to pursue. There are a lot of different ways that I can branch out so I would like to keep exploring those with the help of research. I am looking at the significance of education towards empowering woman, specifically in male-dominated fields. Another fascinating concept could be a reflective interactive space which allowed people to explore their identity and self.</p>
