        <p>The universal epidemic of sexism is popularly recognized in every industry. For my academic research, I focused on interactive spaces online and in the tech industry. The following several articles and websites discuss the gender discrimination and its consequences. In the article “AI Can Be Sexist and Racist”, highlights the significance of data and how subsequently skewed data leads to sexism. The growing scope of AI makes it vital to address the growing bias in the decision making outcomes.</p>
        <p>There have been multiple studies showcasing the negative impacts of using female voice assistants. A United Nations report finds that the use of this voice assistant helps reinforce gender biases. Its mannerism, attitude and speech sends a signal that women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helps whose main responsibility is to be of service. For my final project, I want to fight these gender biases and work on relieving the gender roles in tech industries. </p>
        <p>My interactivity app or website would allow the user to interact with the interface without encouraging any gender biases. It would be able to answer limited questions and help the user find information without a female persona. </p>

        <p>Alexa is a virtual assistant AI developed by Amazon, first used in the Amazon Echo. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information. It can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system. As a virtual assistant, Alexa is widely popular due to its easy and cohesive smart system. However, we see the same problem in Alexa, as it's complete identity is female-driven.</p>
        <p>Tech companies most likely gender their voice assistants as female because research shows that when people need help, they prefer to hear it delivered in a female voice. This is even worse when compared to results showing that people prefer male voices when it comes to authoratative statements. The authors in a UNESCO study point out that people sometimes direct verbal abuse or sexual innuendo at these female voice assistants, which tend to respond with disturbingly docile responses. All of the data backing up this information makes me realise that I am headed in the right direction. </p>
        <p>In summary, I am trying to focus on this situation with an ethical mindset and not choosng the easiest path. While these A.I's do a great job of completing the task they set out to do, they still don't take into account the social repercussions. My interactive app or website won't come close to the efficiency of these virtual assistants but it won't play into gender stereotypes. </p>
